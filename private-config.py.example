# This file contains instance-specific variables, and you should definitely
# change them from their defaults!
#
# You should edit this file, rename is to "private-config.py", and Flask
# will look for this file in $PREFIX/var/nido-instance, where $PREFIX is
# the prefix of your Python installation.
#
# If you are running this package in a development environment, you will
# place this file with your own settings in a directory called instance/ in
# the same directory as the root nido/ directory.
