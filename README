Initial configuration (to run from /dev):
- Rename dev/cfg/config-example.yaml to dev/cfg/config.yaml with your own settings.
- Set absolute path to config.yaml in dev/config.py
- Use /run-dev.sh to run the application from the /dev environment.

Use the script /push2prod.sh to copy the contents of /dev to /prod to allow you to
run separate development and production versions.
