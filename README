Installation:
- Run install.sh to install required Python modules and Node.js components.

Initial configuration:
- Rename app/cfg/config-example.yaml to app/cfg/config.yaml with your own settings.
- Set absolute path to config.yaml in app/lib/NidoConfig.py.

Generating a test build:
- npm run build

Optional (automate jsx -> js translation):
- Install watchman as per instructions here: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html
- Watch the React source:
  watchman watch ./app
- Run build process on file changes:
  watchman -- trigger ./app build-jsx '*.js' -- npm run build

Generating a production build
- npm run build-prod

Running the application:
- sudo python app/nido.py        (Flask server)
- sudo python app/nidod.py start (daemon)
  Note: sudo is required due to hardware access to GPIO pins
  You may want to add these commands to your /etc/rc.local file so that Nido runs at startup.
